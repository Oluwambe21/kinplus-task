steps to use vulnix 
1. **Initial Enumeration**:
   - Conduct a port scan using `unicornscan`.
   - Discover open ports: SSH (22), SMTP (25), POP3 (110), NFS (2049), and others.
   - Attempt UDP port scan as well.

2. **NFS Enumeration**:
   - Identify NFS shares.
   - Attempt to mount the NFS share, facing issues with port configurations.

3. **SMTP Enumeration**:
   - Use Nmap to enumerate SMTP service.
   - Discover VRFY command available, indicating user enumeration.

4. **User Enumeration**:
   - Utilize `smtp-user-enum` tool to enumerate users.
   - Use finger service to further enumerate users.
   - Create a Bash script for automating user enumeration.

5. **Exploitation**:
   - Recognize the unique user "user" as a potential target.
   - Attempt SSH brute force using the rockyou.txt wordlist.
   - Successfully brute force the SSH login for user "user".

6. **Post-Exploitation**:
   - Conduct LinEnum for post-exploitation enumeration.
   - Discover NFS configuration with root squash.
   - Attempt to create a user with the same UID as the NFS share, but encounter issues due to disk space constraints.
   - Generate SSH keys for user "vulnix" but face issues due to disk space limitations.
